SMTP Email Library
------------------------------------

Version: 1.1
Author: Alistair Kearney (alistair@symphony-cms.com)
Build Date: 12th Feb 2010
Requirements: Symphony 2.0.6 or above

Establishes a direct SMTP connection with target email server rather than rely on PHP's flaky mail() function.

A replacement for the built in "Send Email" functionality of Symphony's core. Includes an event filter as well as a class for developers to use. This extension makes use of the PEAR Mail library.

[INSTALLATION]

1. Upload the 'smtp_email_library' folder in this archive to your Symphony 'extensions' folder.

2. Enable it by selecting the "SMTP Email Library", choose Enable from the with-selected menu, then click Apply.

Note: If your server already has PEAR installed, you may need to remove the folder "extension/smtp_email_library/lib/pear" otherwise class name classes could occur.

[CHANGE LOG]

	1.1	- Fixed some small bugs that appear when using Symphony 2.0.7RC1
	1.0 - Initial Release

[USAGE]

- Add the "Send Email via Direct SMTP Connection" to your events and follow the documentation that gets added to your Event.

- Developers can include extensions/smtp_email_library/lib/class.email.php. Use the following example code:

	$email = new LibraryEmail;

	$email->to = sprintf('%s <%s>', 'Fred Smith', 'fred@smith.com');
	$email->from = sprintf('%s <%s>', 'You', 'you@yoursite.com');
	$email->subject = 'Test Email;
	$email->message = 'Blah Blah Blah, this is the email body'
	$email->setHeader('Reply-To', 'noreply@mysite.com');

	try{
		$email->send();
	}
	catch(Exception $e){
		die("Oh Oh! Something failed: " . $e->getMessage());
	}
